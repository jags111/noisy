# Noisy

A diffusion model for image generation with an emphasis on clean and readable
code as well as easy monitoring during training.

CLI commands:

- `./cli.py init` - Creates a new *project*, based on `/configs/default.yaml`.
- `./cli.py train` - Starts training the previously created project.
- `./cli.py syn` - Synergizes a new image and displays it using matplotlib.

To get more options for each command, add the `--help` flag.
